- 👋 Hi, I’m @balotofi aka Kenny
- 👀 I’m interested in space flight software and social commentary.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning orbital mechanics and Aerospace with Python from Alfredo Gonzales.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything aerospace related with Python, if you could teach me C++ I wouldn't mind either.
- 📫 How to reach me hebalogun@gmail.com
